Two children, a beautiful mother (Edna Purviance) and Charlie leave the house and enter their Model T Ford. Charlie attempts to start the car. It shimmers and shakes but the engine dies, every time Charlies tries to enter the driver seat. Turning the starting crank handle the opposite way causes smoke shoots out. Finally, a minor adjustment to the engine and they are on their way.The family enters the ferry boat. Charlie carries one child under each arm because children in arms are free. They find their seats. Charlie leaves momentarily. In his absence, his seat is occupied by a large man (Tom Wilson) and his wife (Babe London). Charlie wedges his way in when he returns. He sticks the man with a pin to make room. Then Charlie leaves the boat again to buy cigarettes.The captain calls all aboard and the boat starts to pull away from the pier. A heavy woman (Tom Wood) arrives just as the boat is depart and fires her baby carriage across the bow. She trips as she tries to board and stretches herself between the boat and the landing. When Charlie returns, he is able to walk across the woman's back to board the boat. The heavy set woman falls into the water. Charlie thinks it may be helpful to use a gaff pole to help her climb onto the boat. Finally, she is helped on board and the trip is underway.A black band of ragtime musicians provides music. Several couples begin dancing. Charlie and his wife are among them. Dancing is a challenge as the boat tosses in the waves. Charlie and many others do not look like they are feeling too well overcome with seasickness. With rougher waters, the dance floor clears and many people cling to the edge of the boat. Charlie tries to find his balance on the dance floor alone. Eventually, Charlie finds a seat near the trombone player and has to navigate the trombone's slide continually. Charles, the trombone player and the drummer all are consumed with the same thought of seasickness. The trombone player is so ill his face turns white. Charlies seeks another location.A vendor pressures Charlie to buy ham sandwiches, buttered popcorn, cigars or cigarettes. Charlie returns to his snoozing family and struggles to set up a deck chair. The fat couple who occupied the seat earlier are near. The fat man eats popcorn, feels ill and leaves. Frustrated, Charlie throws the deck chair overboard and seats himself next to the fat woman. She is also not feeling well and faints into Charlie's lap. Charlie props her up but succumbs to the seasickness can keels over face first into the woman's lap. A steward comes along and puts a blanket over Charlie and the woman. The man returns, bringing a drink for his wife. Charlie extends his arm from under the blanket. The man thinks he is holding his wife's hand as Charlies wave his rejection of the drink. When Charlie is discovered under the blanket, the man flings Charlie across the deck and a fight ensues. Charlie is choked repeatedly but is saved when the man runs across the deck to lean over the edge with sea sickness. Charlie finds this the ideal opportunity to kick the man's posterior. Then Charlie pulls him away and dominates the fight with the much larger man. The captain finally intercedes in the fight between the two very tired and seasick men. At the end of the cruise, the day trippers disembark. The large man Charlie was fighting has a black eye.On the way home, the family encounters a hold up at the crossroads where a traffic officer directs traffic. When Charlie's Model T approaches the corner, Charlie fails to yield to the traffic cop's direction. The traffic officer politely asks Charlie to reverse back to the corner and wait. A woman pedestrian meets another lady and her husband crossing the street in front of Charlie's car. Charlie blows his horn repeatedly but they do not move. The short little man (Loyal Underwood) leans against Charlie's car tire. Charlie reverses the car and the man tumbles to the ground. Finally, the pedestrians retreat to the street corner. The man cusses out Charlie as a stupid ass. Charlie plugs his ears with his fingers.Charlie again tries to proceed with his left turn. The traffic cop stops him again. This time he issues Charlie a citation. When Charlie backs his car to the corner, he bumps into a truck carrying a large box which tips over onto another vehicle with a well-dressed man inside. The traffic offer intervenes. The well-dressed man's car is allowed to proceed. The truck forced to back up.As Charlie waits, men wheel a barrel of tar out in front of Charlie's car. When another car backs up, the barrel of hot tar in spilled in front of Charlie's car. Charlie pulls ahead and his car become stuck. Charlie cannot move ahead when the traffic officer signals him. A portly officer (Henry Bergman) approaches and clears the tar bucket and street workers from the scene. The officer is forced backward by another car reversing and gets his feet stuck in the tar. Now both Charlie's car and the officer are stuck in the tar. The traffic officer approaches to give Charlie yet another citation. The portly officer frees himself from the tar. In the process, he steps on a manhole cover behind the traffic officer and removes it. The traffic officer disappears down the manhole. The portly officer replaces the manhole cover and approaches Charlie. When Charlie notices him, he says \"how you have changed.\" This results in a confrontation where Charlie is pulled from his car by the portly officer and tossed back into the tar. Charlie's feet are so embedded in the tar that he can lean forward without falling over much to the delight of the growing crowd of pedestrians. The portly officer tells him \"you've been sticking around here long enough.\" As the altercation continues, the portly officer ends up with both feet and hands stuck in the tar. The traffic officer climbs out of the manhole and trips over the other officer. The traffic officer also ends up stuck in the tar. Charlie removes his shoes steps on the officer's hat and climbs down the officers back to free himself from the sticky situation. Charlie climbs back into his car, puts it in reverse, and drives around *the officers who are still stuck, one on top of the other. It is the end of a perfect day. 7*\n"}

CALIGARIFrancis (Friedrich Feher) and an older man are sitting in a garden, telling stories. A girl (Lil Dagover) walks past, unresponsive, as in a daze. Francis says she is his fianc\u00e9e Jane and that the story of how she got that way will be amazing.It all started when a carnival came to his hometown of Hostenwall . . . (we go into flashback) . . .Francis and his best friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski) together with Jane go to the carnival for fun. They are enticed by an older mountebank (Werner Krauss) calling himself Dr. Caligari to enter his tent to see his amazing somnambulist Cesare (Conrad Veidt) who has been asleep for 25 years and, under Dr. Caligari's command, is about to awaken.After some people enter the tent and sit down, Dr. Caligari opens a vertical cabinet shaped like a mummys sarcophagus, and we see Cesare is a gaunt young man who wakes and steps forward in extreme slow motion. Supposedly he spends his life sleeping in the cabinet and is able to predict the future when awake. Caligari brags that Cesare can answer any question whatsoever.When Alan asks Cesare how long he has to live, the answer is that Alan will die before dawn tomorrow. This unsettling prediction cuts their fun short, so Alan, Francis, and Jane go home. Jane is particularly affected, since, at that time, she was Alans girl friend although she knew that Francis was also in love with her.After night comes, we see, inside Alan's rooms, the shadows of Alan and his killer fighting on his bedroom wall.Alan is found murdered the next morning. Francis goes to tell the police after he realizes the somnambulist's prophecy has come true. Suspicion turns to the eerie somnambulist and his strange handler.Before police do anything, an attempted murder of an old woman takes place, throwing the town into panic.Back at Dr. Caligari's wagon, we see him feeding gruel to Cesare as he sits in a coffin. When police knock at the wagon asking questions, they are shown Cesare inside the coffin, and Caligari protests that he doesnt ever leave the coffin without his permission.At some point a common criminal confesses to the attempted murder of the old lady, so the police are back to investigating Alans murder only. Francis, along with Jane, keep investigating Caligari and Cesare.\nCaligari orders Cesare to kill Jane. Cesare creeps into Jane's bedroom and as he lifts a knife to kill her, she screams and faints. He carries Jane out of her house, leading the townsfolk on a lengthy chase. Cesare falls from a height to his death to end the pursuit.The townsfolk discover a dummy in Cesare's cabinet, and that Caligari has fled.Francis goes to a nearby insane asylum to inquire whether the fled Dr. Caligari might be a patient there. The worker he speaks with tells him he must go see the director of the institute for patient information, as he's not allowed to discuss any of that.Francis goes to the director's office and it turns out the director and Dr. Caligari are one and the same person.Francis gets the police over there and after looking through books and notebooks in the office, they discover a historical book about a mythical Caligari, who did just what Dr. Caligari is doing now, back in 1793 in northern Italy. The XIth century Caligari used a hypnotized somnambulist to murder people. The director has notes to suggest he is trying to recreate the XIth Century events.When the director arrives, after being confronted with the dead Cesare, he goes nuts, saying he must become the new Caligari, so staff in the institute put him in a straight jacket. His mania is manifest, and he is confined in his own asylum.At this point the flashback is over. The expressionist look of buildings is gone. Francis and the man who was told the story wander back from the garden to the institute patio. Cesare is standing in the corner and Francis warns the older man not to accept one of his prophecies, for he would surely die.Jane is there also, and when Francis asks her to marry him, she says she cannot marry someone not of royal blood.Then down the stairs comes Dr. Caligari (the director), and Francis quickly gets in a scuffle with him. Francis is grabbed by the staff and taken upstairs.Dr. Caligari comes to the conclusion that Francis is a maniac and that his mania is caused by his delusion that Dr. Caligari is in fact the mythic Caligari who would wander from town to town with Cesare killing townsfolk.The twist ending reveals that all of the flashback is actually Francis delusion, symbolized in the film by the distorted buildings and landscapes. Francis, Jane and Cesare are all inmates of the insane asylum, and the man he calls Caligari is the asylum director. The director, after this revelation of the sources of his patient's delusion, says that now he should be able to cure Francis.\n"}
